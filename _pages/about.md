I'm currently a Research Associate at the Lahore University of Management Sciences looking at how information speards in online spaces, how it is perceived and how it affects human behavior.
I graduated from King's College London with a masters' in Neuroscience in 2018. There I was part of a team studying the effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on cognition
in Schizophrenia. My research looked at how tDCS affected probablistic learning in patients with schizophrenia. My journey as a researcher started with my Psychology bachelors' thesis
where I researched how personality factors are linked to beliefs about complementary and alternative medicine in Pakistan.
