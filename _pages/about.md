I'm currently a Research Associate at the Lahore University of Management Sciences looking at how information speards in online spaces, how it is perceived and how it affects human behavior. Some of these projects have involved looking at misinformation, vaccine hesitancy, gender roles on social media, and online viral content.


I graduated from King's College London with a masters' in Neuroscience in 2018. There I was part of a team studying the effects of Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation on cognition in Schizophrenia. My research looked at how tDCS affected probablistic learning in patients with schizophrenia. 


My journey as a researcher started with my Psychology bachelors' thesis where I studied how personality factors are linked to beliefs about complementary and alternative medicine in Pakistan. This started a long-standing passion and interest in research work which continues to this day further stoked by wonderful mentors and collaborators.
