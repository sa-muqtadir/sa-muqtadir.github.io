### Abstract


Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) is under clinical investigation as a treatment for cognitive deficits. 
We investigate the effects of tDCS over the mPFC on performance SSLT in individuals with schizophrenia, and the underlying neurophysiological effect in regions associated with learning values and stimulus-outcome relationships. 
In this parallel-design double-blind pilot study, 49 individuals with schizophrenia, of whom 28 completed a fMRI, were randomized into active or sham tDCS stimulation groups. Subjects participated in 4 days of SSLT training (days 1, 2, 14, 56) with tDCS applied at day-1, and during a concurrent MRI scan at day-14. 
The SSLT demonstrated a significant mean difference in performance in the tDCS treatment group: at day-2 and 
at day-56. Active tDCS was associated with increased insular activity, 
and reduced amygdala activation. tDCS may offer an important novel approach to modulating brain networks to ameliorate cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, 
with this study being the first to show a longer-term effect on SSLT.
