### Abstract
This extended abstract presents an examination of audience-peers effects on the perception of “taboo product” advertisements in a conservative culture. 
Using naturalistic stimuli consisting of professionally produced contraceptive advertisements, 
the study measured the level of the perceived offense for four audience-peer conditions. 
Preliminary analysis revealed significant differences in mean offense scores across all audience-peer conditions, 
with private and family conditions garnering the highest and lowest perceived offense scores respectively.
We posit that these differences could be the result of a face-work mechanism as set out in the Face Negotiation Theory and may have strong implications for sexual health communication design, especially for conservative audiences.
